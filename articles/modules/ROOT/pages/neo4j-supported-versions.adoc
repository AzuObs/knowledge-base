The driver major.minor version number describes the feature set available within that driver. Across languages, drivers are generally 
released at similar times, although patches are driver-dependent. The 1.x series drivers have been built for Neo4j 3.x. It is
recommended to always use the latest driver release available. This will ensure that all server functionality is made available to
client applications.

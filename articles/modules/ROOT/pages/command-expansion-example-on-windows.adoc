The **Command Expansion** feature, introduced in **Neo4j 4.2**, is a security feature to avoid having configuration parameters being written in the `neo4j.conf` file in plain text.

The commands are executed within the child process by the user _who owns and executes the Neo4j server_. So, by definition, only the user running the Neo4j process/service would be able to use this feature.

The Command Expansion is very sensitive about the permissions assigned on the `neo4j.conf` file. If the permissions are not set appropriately, then Neo4j fails to start showing messages similar to:

[source,properties]
----
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 
<NEO4J_HOME>/conf/neo4j.conf does not have the correct file permissions to evaluate commands.
Has [OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE, OTHERS_READ, GROUP_READ], requires at most [OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE].

That's why the need for this article!

Moreover, the Neo4j documentation has provided examples for the Linux based installs, so here is a fun example (step-by-step) of using the Command Expansion on Windows:

- Change the `neo4j.conf` file to have the following setting:

[source,properties]
----
dbms.max_databases=$(my_setting.bat)
----

- Create an environment variable:

[source,properties]
----
MAX_DATABASES=16
----

- Create a simple batch file `my_setting.bat`:

[source,properties]
----
@ECHO OFF
ECHO %MAX_DATABASES%
----

- Change the permission on the `neo4j.conf` file to `Read`. Remove all user groups and user names except the user _who owns and executes the Neo4j server_. Refer to the picture below:

_In the Linux world, this would be equivalent to `r-- --- ---`, which is done by:_

[source,properties]
----
$chmod 400 neo4j.conf
----

- Start Neo4j using the following command -

[source,properties]
----
C:\neo4j-enterprise-4.2.3-windows\neo4j-enterprise-4.2.3\bin>neo4j console --expand-commands
----

During the start, the console would show the following INFO messages:

[source,properties]
----
2021-03-04 03:17:40.575+0000 INFO  Command expansion is explicitly enabled for configuration
2021-03-04 03:17:40.577+0000 INFO  Executing external script to retrieve value of setting dbms.max_databases
2021-03-04 03:17:40.579+0000 INFO  Starting...
2021-03-04 03:17:43.311+0000 INFO  ======== Neo4j 4.2.3 ========

2021-03-04 03:17:46.819+0000 INFO  Started.
----


- To confirm that the `dbms.max_databases` property has been set to `16`, execute the following command in the Neo4j Browser:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL dbms.listConfig() YIELD name, value WHERE name = 'dbms.max_databases' RETURN value
----

The result would be `16`.

**Note** that by default, the file permissions on the `neo4j.conf` would look as shown below.

All users such as `Authenticated Users`, `SYSTEM`, `Administrators`, `Users`, etc. will need to be removed.

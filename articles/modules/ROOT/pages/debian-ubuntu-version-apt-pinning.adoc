If you want to run a specific version of Neo4j and install the software via a https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/linux/debian/#debian[debian repository^] you need to use a technique called https://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences[apt pinning^]. Otherwise, any system update will also update Neo4j to its latest stable version.

As an example assume you want to make sure to stay on 3.5.x versions - effectively preventing an upgrade to 4.x or higher.
To use apt pinning create a file `/etc/apt.d/preferences.d/neo4j` with these contents:

....
Package: neo4j-enterprise
Pin: version 1:3.5.*
Pin-Priority: 1000
....

[NOTE]
====
Recently the versioning scheme for neo4j debian packages changed and a `1:` is used as a prefix.
